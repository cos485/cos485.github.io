Organization of synaptic connectivity as the basis of neural
computation and learning. Perceptrons, convolutional nets, and
recurrent nets. Backpropagation and Hebbian learning. Engineering
applications including computer vision and natural language
processing.

### Requirements
  - Two 80 minute lectures and one precept per week.  
  - Grades (A-F) will be based on class participation (5%), problem sets (25%), midterm (30%), and final exam (40%).
  - Participation includes speaking up in lecture and precept.
  - Participation also includes activity on Piazza---ideally asking good questions, giving good answers, and upvoting others' contributions.

### Prerequisites
  - Familiarity with linear algebra.
  - Basics of optimization and probability theory.
  - Knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn).

### Lectures
Prof. Sebastian Seung will lecture twice a week.

- TTh 3-4:20pm [Friend Center][friend-center] 101

### Precepts
Davit Buniatyan, Kyle Luther, Tommy Macrina, and Riley Simmons-Edler will lead the weekly precepts.

- F	9:00-9:50 am [Friend Center][friend-center]	009, Kyle Luther
- F 9:00-9:50 am [Friend Center][friend-center] 108, Davit Buniatyan
- M	3:30-4:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center]	009, Tommy Macrina
- M	7:30-8:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center] 003, Riley Simmons-Edler

### Office Hours
There will be 2 sets of office hours every week. Each AI will hold office hours every other week. So Tommy Macrina and Kyle Luther will hold Tuesday and Wednesday office hours one week, then Riley Simons-Edler and Davit Buniatyan will hold Tuesday and Wednesday office hours the next week and so on.

- T 4:30-5:30 pm [PNI][pni] 176D, Tommy Macrina and Riley Simons-Edler
- W 3:30-4:30 pm [PNI][pni] 176D, Kyle Luther and Davit Buniatyan


### Online discussions
You can ask and answer questions on the [Piazza site](https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2018/cos485/home).  Piazza activity counts as class participation and can enhance your grade.


### Homework assignments
Homework assignments will be due on Mondays, and should be submitted at the [Blackboard site](https://blackboard.princeton.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course&course_id=_6115916_1&handle=cp_announcements&mode=cpview).  The programming component should be submitted as a Jupyter notebook. Please submit (i) the Python notebook file, and (ii) a HTML export of the notebook clearly showing all answers and plots/visualizations.

### Online discussions
You can ask and answer questions on the [Ed site](https://edstem.org/us/courses/36236/discussion/).  Ed activity counts as class participation and can enhance your grade.

### Final Project Guidelines
There will be no final exam in this class. Instead, a final project will be worth 25% of your grade. More details will be posted later on.

### Homework assignments
Homework assignments will be due on Fridays, and should be submitted on gradescope.

### Homework late policy

There is a accumulated percentage drop on the overall points of 20% per day (eg. 2 days late => -40%). If you have reasons (eg. conference, illness, ...) for why you cannot make a deadline, write us (all instructors) an E-mail *before* the deadline including a suggested new deadline. We will grant requests on an individual basis.

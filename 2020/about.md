Organization of synaptic connectivity as the basis of neural
computation and learning. Perceptrons, convolutional nets, and
recurrent nets. Backpropagation and Hebbian learning. Engineering
applications including computer vision and natural language
processing.

### Requirements
  - Two 80 minute lectures and one precept per week.  
  - Grades (A-F) will be based on class participation (5%), problem sets (45%), midterm (20%), and [final project](https://www.notion.so/COS485-Final-Project-Guidelines-7bcd475f0c41449780d972d4277383ba) (30%).
  - Participation includes speaking up in lecture and precept.
  - Participation also includes activity on Piazza---ideally asking good questions, giving good answers, and upvoting others' contributions.

### Prerequisites
  - Familiarity with linear algebra.
  - Basics of optimization and probability theory.
  - Knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn).

### Lectures
Prof. Sebastian Seung will lecture twice a week.

- TTh 3-4:20pm [McCosh Hall][mccosh-hall] 46

### Office Hours
 
- M	3:30-4:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center]	110 [Zoom](https://princeton.zoom.us/j/882927292), Xingyuan Sun
- M	7:30-8:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center] 108 [Zoom](https://princeton.zoom.us/j/911464581), Sven Dorkenwald
- F 9:00-9:50 am [Friend Center][friend-center] 008 [Zoom](https://princeton.zoom.us/j/782205150), "Tony" Runzhe Yang


### Online discussions
You can ask and answer questions on the [Piazza site](https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2020/cos485/home).  Piazza activity counts as class participation and can enhance your grade.

### Final Project Guidelines
You will be expected to complete a mini-project on either a theoretical or an applied neural network problem. The project is worthÂ 30% of your grade. You will collaborate in groups of 3-4 people with the help of our project mentors. More details about project ideas, milestones, and grade breakdowns can be found in [the final project guidelines](https://www.notion.so/COS485-Final-Project-Guidelines-7bcd475f0c41449780d972d4277383ba).

### Homework assignments
Homework assignments will be due on Tuesdays, and should be submitted on gradescope.

### Homework late policy

There is a accumulated percentage drop on the overall points of 20% per day (eg. 2 days late => -40%). If you have reasons (eg. conference, illness, ...) for why you cannot make a deadline, write us (all instructors) an E-mail *before* the deadline including a suggested new deadline. We will grant requests on an individual basis.

- All homework assignments are due on Fridays (see [schedule](/2025/schedule/)), and should be submitted through Gradescope.  


- Theoretical exercises are encouraged to be completed using LaTeX.
  - If you choose to use LaTeX, make a branch from the provided overleaf project. Please type your answers in the solution boxes. You will see answer boxes that looks like the codeblock below after the question statements. You should substitute the comment with your answer.
  ```tex
  \begin{tcolorbox}[answerbox,height=2cm]
    Your Answer Here
  \end{tcolorbox}
  ``` 
  - You may submit a scan or photograph of hand-written work. If you choose to do so, please print out the assignment PDF and write your solutions in the designated answer boxes. Directly overwriting on PDFs using tablets is also accepted. Solutions outside the answer boxes may not be graded.


- Programming exercises should be completed in Colaboratory.  

  - Please submit to Gradescope a PDF of your notebook as well as your raw notebook file.

  - A simple method to generate a PDF of your Colaboratory consists in using the built-in browser print and save the result as a pdf.

- For Colaboratory notebook submissions, please
 
  - make sure that all cell outputs are clearly visible before saving the notebook.
  
  - set the share permissions so that "Anyone with the link can view"
  
  - see the [Using Colaboratory](/2024/02/05/using-colaboratory.html) post for more information.

- You may collaborate with others when solving the problems, but your writeup should be your own work.

- Please list the names of your collaborators (if any) on your submission.

- Explain your work as concisely as possible. You may be graded on clarity of explanation, as well as “correctness.”

- We may take off points if it hard to read your solution or if your solution is too long and the question is simple.

- When you draw graphs, make them as informative as possible by labeling the axes and by annotating important locations.

### Due at 3:00 pm on Friday, March 24th. Please submit to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/508917). Please follow the general [guidelines](https://cos485.github.io/2023/01/29/homework-guidelines.html) regarding homework assignments.

1. After applying Layer Normalization, what is the Euclidean norm of the activity vector?

2. Consider Algorithm 4 in Phuong and Hutter, for the case of self-attention. Suppose that $$W_k$$ is the identity matrix $$I$$ and $$W_q = \omega I$$. Assume that all tokens have the same Euclidean norm, and are distinct from each other. What is the output of the algorithm in the limit as $$\omega\to\infty$$?

3. Suppose that $$W_k = 0$$ and $$W_q$$ is arbitrary. What is the output of Algorithm 4?

4. What is the complexity of Algorithm 5, measured in number of multiply-adds? You can neglect the computations involving bias vectors, and the softmax computation of Eq. (2). Consider both bidirectional and unidirectional cases. Your answer will contain a sum of terms. Which one dominates for GPT-3?

For the last question, you can consult the [GPT-3 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165v4) for model hyperparameters, which are also summarized at the end of the [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) README.

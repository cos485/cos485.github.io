- All homework assignments are due on Fridays (see [schedule](http://cos485.github.io/2023/schedule/)), and should be submitted through Gradescope.  

- Programming exercises should be completed in Colaboratory.  

  - Please submit to Gradescope a PDF of your notebook including a link to your Colaboratory file.

- Theoretical exercises are encouraged to be completed in Colaboratory using LaTeX, as well. You may also submit a PDF scan of a handwritten response.

  - Please submit to Gradescope a PDF.
  
- A simple method to generate a PDF of your Colaboratory consists in using the built-in browser print and save the result as a pdf.

- On Gradescope, you can only submit one PDF file for the whole HW. Please create a PDF file for each notebook and merge all the PDF files you have. 

-  Regarding the code, you only need to share a link directing to your Colab notebooks (and ensure that you grant access to your Colab). Please paste your
   Colab links at the beginning of your submission. 

- For Colaboratory notebook submissions, please
 
  - make sure that all cell outputs are clearly visible before saving the notebook.
  
  - set the share permissions so that "Anyone with the link can view"
  
  - see the [Using Colaboratory](https://cos485.github.io/2023/01/29/using-colaboratory.html) post for more information.

- You may collaborate with others when solving the problems, but your writeup should be your own work.

- Please list the names of your collaborators (if any) on your submission.

- Explain your work as concisely as possible. You may be graded on clarity of explanation, as well as “correctness.”

- We may take off points if it hard to read your solution or if your solution is too long and the question is simple.

- When you draw graphs, make them as informative as possible by labeling the axes and by annotating important locations.

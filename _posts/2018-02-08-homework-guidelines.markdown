- All homework assignments are due on Thursday (see [schedule](http://cos485.github.io/schedule/)), and should be submitted through Blackboard.  

- Programming exercises should be completed in Colaboratory.  

  - Please submit to Blackboard (i) a link to your Colaboratory file using the comments, and (ii) the notebook itself.

- Theoretical exercises are encouraged to be completed in Colaboratory using LaTeX, as well. You may also submit a PDF scan of a handwritten response.

  - If using Colaboratory, please submit to Blackboard (i) a link to your Colaboratory file using the comments, and (ii) the notebook itself.
  
- For Colaboratory notebook submissions, please
 
  - make sure that all cell outputs are clearly visible before saving the notebook.
  
  - set the share permissions so that "Anyone with the link can view"
  
  - note that when we evaluate notebooks using your link, we will grade the revision with the last timestamp that's before the assignment deadline.
  
  - submit the .ipynb file and not the .py file (`File > Download .ipynb`).
  
  - see the [Using Colaboratory](https://cos485.github.io/general/2018/02/08/using-colaboratory.html) post for more information.

- You may collaborate with others when solving the problems, but your writeup should be your own work.

- Please list the names of your collaborators (if any) on your submission.

- Explain your work as concisely as possible. You may be graded on clarity of explanation, as well as “correctness.”

- When you draw graphs, make them as informative as possible by labeling the axes and by annotating important locations.

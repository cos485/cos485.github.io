# Grading Note
We've calculated midpoint grades based on pset01, pset02, and the midterm according to the following formula:

$$\frac{1}{4}\frac{2}{9}\text{PSET01} + \frac{1}{4}\frac{2}{9}\text{PSET01} + \frac{3}{10}\text{MIDTERM}$$

Here is the distribution of those midpoint grades for all undergraduates in the class:
![midpoint grades]({{ site.url }}/_posts/180405 scaled midpoint grades undergrads.png)

This distribution has the following statistics:
```
60	1st quartile
71	2nd quartile
83	3rd quartile
71	mean
16	stdev
```

If we were to roughly assign grades, right now, these would be the following ranges:
```
A	>85
B	65-85
C	51-65
D	41-50
F	<41
```

This should serve as a rough guide to how you’re doing so far. We can’t guarantee any particular distribution of final grades: the final median could be higher or lower than B, and the percent score required for a given letter grade might increase or decrease depending on how the class performs on the remainder of the assignments and the final.

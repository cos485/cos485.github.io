To clarify our late policy:

- If you need an extension on an assignment and have a valid reason for it, please email Prof. Seung in advance of the deadline. 

- Valid reasons for extensions are "unavoidable" events that can't reasonably be planned for or scheduled around. Examples include: 

   - unplanned travel  
   - sickness/injury  
   - family emergencies  
   - registering for the class that week.  

- Extensions will typically be for 72 hours, i.e. until 2:59 PM EST on Monday. Only for extraordinary circumstances will longer extensions be granted. 

- If you submit late without an extension, you will get -20% off your grade on the assignment for each day late, up to two days after the deadline (i.e. until Monday afternoon). After that late assignments will not be accepted. 

   - If you are unable to submit on time and not physically able to inform Prof. Seung beforehand (e.g. due to serious injury), we will make special considerations, but otherwise you must notify us in advance to get an extension.
